This product includes software adapted from the TTS-GAN repository by Gong et al.,
available at https://github.com/imics-lab/tts-gan, which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

The code in this repository is based on the original TTS-GAN project.
Significant modifications have been made to integrate the model with structural health monitoring (SHM) applications,
to support experimental acceleration datasets, and to enable the generation of synthetic structural response signals
through domain-specific preprocessing and architecture customization.
